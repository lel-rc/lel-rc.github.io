# arcinas.info

This site aims to be a repository for all the incoherently rambling things I write, as well as a site to post personal projects that may or may not involve code. This site is open-source and static, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). [Link to the Github repo](https://github.com/lel-rc/lel-rc.github.io).
